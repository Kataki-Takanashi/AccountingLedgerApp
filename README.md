### Project Overview

This is a simple ledger application I built as part of my bootcamp capstone project. 
The app can read a transactions.csv file, add deposits or payments, and display a ledger of all transactions. 
It also allows you to filter the transactions based on different criteria, like deposits, payments, or custom searches.
